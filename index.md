# Oliver's 3rd Birthday Gift Ideas

## CAR TOYS (This is his most requested item)

Anything construction, firetruck, ambulance, school bus, car, truck, garbage truck, plane, jet, helicopter, ...

He doesn't have a ***tow truck*** and he would really like that.

His current Tonka-like toy collection is a dump truck, back hoe / front loader, and garbage truck. He would love an ***excavator***, an ***ambulance***, a ***bulldozer*** and/or a ***grader***.

A sandbox (with lid) would go really well with these types of toys.

## Favorite Characters

Oliver loves Pupstruction the most, but also loves Paw Patrol, Super Kitties, Elmo / Sesame Street
